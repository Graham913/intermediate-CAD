## Skateboard
Make a skateboard in onshape
I followed the directions to make a skateboard in onshape and used different new tools to make is as easy as possible.
### Evidence
[this is the onshape link to all of the parts to my skateboard](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/032a6482e5c1d130d788f734/w/6abbcdf30997bde5060588f8/e/b2e8b9f93d1255c0b3afec04) 

#### 2.1 The Deck
2.1-The deck is really simple but I have to make sure to double check all of the smart dimensions to get the right mass

#### 2.2 Trucks and Bushing
2.2-Make sure to sketch on the right plane and select the right plane when making the holes or youll have to basically start over. Using the D hotkey for dimensions to make it go a lot faster.

#### 2.3 Wheel and Bearing
2.3-Again double check the dimensions and make sure the entire sketch of the wheel is above the plane so it doesn't cross itself when you revolve it

#### 2.4 The Assembly
2.4-Have your assembly in a different tab then the directions so that you dont have to go back and forth in the worst way possible. Use the m hotkey for fastened mates because it reduces time.
