### Reflections
2.1-The deck is really simple but I have to make sure to double check all of the smart dimensions to get the right mass

2.2-Make sure to sketch on the right plane and select the right plane when making the holes or youll have to basically start over

2.3-Again double check the dimensions and make sure the entire sketch of the wheel is above the plane so it doesn't cross itself when you revolve it

2.4-Have your assembly in a different tab then the directions so that you dont have to go back and forth in the worst way possible
